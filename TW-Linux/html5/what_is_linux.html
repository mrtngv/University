        <p class="p">Just like Windows and Mac, Linux is an operating system. It is created by Linux Torvalds
            who was designed the core of the operating system back when he was a student for one of
            his classes. It is based on UNIX, but it has a greater success, because of the great
            community, open-source and hey, it is free!</p>

        <p class="p">Open source means that you have unlimited access to the code and you can design
            everything as you want. And for that reason there are hundreds of different
            interpretations for Linux, that are called Distributions or distros. Distros may be
            represent as different flavors, from one User Interface to another, they may have
            different settings but from the inside they are still Linux. Here is List of the most
            common ones: </p>
        <p class="p"> - Ubuntu</p>
        <p class="p"> - Linux Mint </p>
        <p class="p"> - Debian</p>
        <p class="p"> - Fedora</p>
        <p class="p"> - Open Suse</p>
