            <p> The first command from this chapter is going to be one of the most important ones.
                It simply says:</p>
            <p> Print Working Directory. As we know the directory is just a file, which is
                representing a content, or dynamic linking with flag which tells us that this file
                is a directory. We can move through the system when we are going to such a file. So
                pwd will basically print the current directory which we are in at the moment.</p>
