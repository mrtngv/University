        <p class="p"> Flags are simply options to the commands. As far we know how to list the files that are
            in the current directory. It is done by ls command. We also know a little bit about
            permissions. So let’s see how we can see the permissions on the files. It is done by
            giving the command ls a flag l – for long</p>
        <p class="p">ls -l</p>
        <p class="p">Now we can see a list of files with their permissions and there are rwe (read write
            execute), </p>
        <p class="p"> but why are they repeated 3 times.</p>
        <p class="p"> It is because the permissions are grouped by: Owner of the file rights, Group Rights,
            Other Rights.</p>
