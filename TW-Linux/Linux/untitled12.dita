            <p>touch is using for two things. The first purpose is to make file by doing</p>
            <p> touch &lt;name of the file> and it place an empty file in your current location. And
                the second thing it does is to change the -last modified time of the file to the
                time when the command is executed.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The command rm or remove is used to remove a single file from your current locations.
                Just provide the command a parameter â€“ the name of the file which you want to be
                removed and it is done. The most common used flags of the remove command are -r and
                -f -r -> recursively it removes every file from the directory of your choice . -f ->
                force, without asking for permissions on every step of the deleting process. Try rm
                -rf / ðŸ˜Š or Or donâ€™t ! // It will remove our your files including the Linux OS.</p>
