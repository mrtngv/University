    <title>What is Linux Shell? </title>
    <shortdesc></shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p> Shell is a program in Linux, which reads an given input from the user {command and
            parameters} and based on that input gives an output. Shell can be runed from both GUI
            and CLI. </p>
        <p>There are Linux distribution that donâ€™t have Graphical Interfaces, so you must learn to
            navigate easily from the file system from command line first. So, go ahead, install
            Linux on your computer or run it with Virtual Machine. After the installation press
            Ctrl,Alt + T, and I will wait for you in the next chapter.</p>
